# How to propose an asset to "Pimp My Duck" ?

To propose a new asset you have to create a PR with :
- The asset as SVG file into the `/proposals` folder
- Give the asset name and category into the PR description

Here is the category list:
- Eyes
- Glasses
- Hair
- Hats
- Mouth
- Faces
- Wears
- Body tatoo
- Accessories

The asset can be built using the [Zenikanard template](./zenikanard_template.svg) SVG file as reference.

The final asset SVG file must NOT contain the Zenikanard, it's just a template to help the design.

After the PR, reviewed and merged. A maintainer will integrate it into "Pimp My Duck".
